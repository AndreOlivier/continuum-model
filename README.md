Continuum helps you Level Up

The Level-Up toolkit, Continuum, is an improvement framework built by Standard Bank engineers intended to assist you on the continuous improvement journey. 

The goal is to continuously improve engineering capability. 

You can use it to build a heat map of relative strengths and areas of improvement for the organisation and/or teams.
